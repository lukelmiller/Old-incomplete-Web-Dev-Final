      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We started as one man with a truck and a push lawn-mower and now we have turned into a local business that is employee owned and community driven. We love giving back to our community from local employment to doing the local charities' landscaping at no charge. Our small business has always strived to make the community better and it all starts with making the local homes look beautiful at a resonable prices.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our kind and hard working land-scaping crew is well trained and knows exactly what to do and how to do it. We have a no jerk policy and have kept to it every step of the way. That is why so many people love us, not only do we take pride in our work but we also take pride in how we treat our customers. As much as customers drive our business it all truely begins with our employees. We think of kindness as rolling down hill and when we treat our employees nice, they treat you, the customer, better.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With all of this in mind the customer is always top priority. You will always come first so if you ever have issues or need help we will be there ready to rock!</p>
